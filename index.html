      <p><strong>Favorite CMSC subject so far and why: </strong></p>
      <p>I think one of the most useful subjects I have taken is CS 123. During this course I challenged myself to make more efficient algorithms so I can improve the runtime of the programs that I write. Moreover, I like solving problems online and with the new data structures that I learned from this class, I was able to solve new problems I previously thought to be impossible</p>
      <br>

      <p><strong>Favorite PL and why</strong></p>
      <p>Recently I've been solving some problems online and I've learned to appreciate Java more due to the the numerous built-in libraries and it is extremely well documented.</p>

      <p><strong>Hobbies</strong></p>
      <p>I play frisbee and I played baseball varsity for 10 years. I also like to play games in my freetime partcularly CSGO and LoL</p>

      <p><strong>Chilhood dream</strong></p>
      <p>I've always wanted to do something with computers. So I thought I wanted to be a computer engineer but as time passed by I realized I wanted to focus on the software aspect</p>
